# Python Project with uv and Dev Container

This project uses uv for dependency management and a dev container for development.

## Setup

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Install the Dev Containers extension if not already installed.
3. Use Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

This will set up the environment with Python 3.12 and uv.

The virtual environment is managed by uv and located in `.venv`.
